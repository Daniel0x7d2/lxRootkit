# lxRootkit

> introduction

**Linux based Rootkit, for _education_ purposes only!** 🙈 🙊 🙉 

*This is an educatioinal project where I have been learning how to build/compile the linux kernel,
as well as how to debug it. And the **_most_** important thing, is how to develop kernel modules(drivers) for linux based OS. The project it self is devided to **6** sections, or so called  tasks :) like in CTFs from easy to more advanced stuff.* 


> environment
- Linux kernel(could be any version, since the kernel is important here). 
- VM where we can test our RootKitttt 🐛 - **Vmware, VirtualBox, Qemu**.
- Linux kernel *dhaaaa* we need to understand what we are going to subvert right? [Linux kernel source code](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).
- And your favorite text editor since we'll be coding in C. 

**that's it for the environment part**.
