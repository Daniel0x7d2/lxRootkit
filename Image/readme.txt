what this dir contains?

1) kexec.sh: It's the script which deploys our VM based on QEMU. 

2) fs/ 
     - rootfs.ext2: Same as the rootfs.ext4 image but with a different foramtting setup(ext2). 
     - rootfs.ext4: It's the main file system that we would like to have & run(compiled by the "buildroot" project).
     - rootfs.tar: not sure xD.
